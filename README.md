# spriteCloudCucumberBDD
Main Project
1.I run my tests locally via xml runner , cukesrunner and maven verify
2.I created localhost on Jenkins then I added github plugin to jenkins . After that I clone my github codes to jenkins prefences . I triggered via windows batch commands(mvn clean test) .it can be repeated periodically if desired
3.https://app.calliope.pro/reports/136847/public/1596f54a-d34c-4665-b022-4ca0c03b0d63
4.Advantages of calliope.pro in terms of use :
We can easily view all my tests through the Overview and 
BA , developer and tester can work together efficiently. Test results can be delivered to the customer quickly.
Disadvantage of calliope.pro
QA engineers can choose html to easily share their reports with other applications.But unfortunately this format is not supported
5.When writing test scenarios . I determine possible actions to objects.I tied to a minimum of one Requirement or User Story.I avoided creating overly complex Test Scenarios
6.The most important reasons for creating test scenarios 
They help to validate that the software is working accurately for each use case. Test scenario also helps in determining the real world use of the software.
7.For the next step of my project
I have to develop test cases. For now, I need to use my framework, which offers parallel testing, more effectively on virtual machines. I have to look at the new features coming to Selenium 4.0 and work in accordance with the updates.

See you at the next stage
